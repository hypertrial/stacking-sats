# Stacking Sats Master Repo

Welcome to the master repository for the [Hypertrial.ai](https://www.hypertrial.ai/) Stacking Sats initiative — an open-source, performance-based ecosystem for building, testing, and deploying Bitcoin accumulation strategies.

> **Problem Statement:** <br>
> To find this initiative useful, you must first believe that accumulating Bitcoin is worthwhile.
> If not, suppose — *for the sake of contradiction* — that it is. Then continue reading.
>
>  *“If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry”.*
> — Satoshi Nakamoto
>
> As individuals, institutions, and even nations race to accumulate a mathematically scarce asset, we ask:
> Can we do better than dollar-cost averaging (DCA)?
>
> If Bitcoin is good, we want more of it.
> And yes — there are systematic, data-driven strategies that yield more Bitcoin per dollar than naive DCA.

## 🧑‍💻 For Talent

Designing optimal Bitcoin accumulation strategies is a rigorous generalization of dollar-cost averaging. Without rigor, it's easy to produce degenerate strategies that lack statistical significance.

We have defined a framework that constrains the space of valid solutions while preserving the core strengths of DCA. However, the resulting search space is mathematically vast and difficult to navigate.

This is why we have open-sourced the challenge — to invite technical talent around the world to contribute to a real-world Bitcoin quant problem.


### Capstone Projects

[Trilemma Foundation](https://www.trilemma.foundation/) sponsors capstone, practicum, and internship projects across leading university programs. These projects give students the opportunity to work on real-world challenges that bridge the gap between academia and industry.

Students contribute to open-source projects, receive mentorship, and build a public portfolio of work.
