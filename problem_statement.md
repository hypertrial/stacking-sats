## Problem Statement

---

### üß© What Are You Solving?

We want to generalize Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) to maximize Bitcoin accumulation by allowing **dynamic purchases** (variable purchase amounts), while still preserving DCA‚Äôs core benefit: **regular, systematic purchases**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How You‚Äôll Solve It

Build a **feature-driven model** (in Python) that maps historical features to daily purchase proportions (weights).  

> Each weight represents a portion of a fixed budget (normalized to 1) distributed over an investment window.

---

### üéØ Objective

Maximize your model‚Äôs **SPD Percentile** across every 12-month rolling investment window (sliding daily, about 3,075 windows total) over the backtest period `2016-01-01` ‚Üí `2025-06-01`, while also ensuring **consistent outperformance** across all those windows.

### üìä Key Metrics

- **Satoshis per Dollar (SPD)**  
  Measures BTC accumulation per dollar invested:  

  $$
  \text{SPD} = \frac{1}{\text{BTC/USD}} \times 100{,}000{,}000
  $$

- **SPD Percentile**  
  Ranks your SPD between the worst-case (all buys at the highest price) and best-case (all buys at the lowest price) strategies:  

  $$
  \text{SPD}_{\%} = 
  \frac{\text{Your SPD} - \text{Worst SPD}}
       {\text{Best SPD} - \text{Worst SPD}} \times 100
  $$

- **Win Rate**  
  The share of rolling investment windows where your strategy has a higher SPD Percentile than **Uniform DCA** (equal daily purchases):  

  $$
  \text{WinRate} = 
  \frac{\#\{\text{wins}\}}
       {\text{Total Windows}} \times 100
  $$

- **Recency-Weighted SPD Percentile**  
  A weighted average of all rolling-window SPD percentiles (each 12 months long) that places more emphasis on recent windows via exponential decay:  

  $$
  RW_{\text{SPD\%}}
  = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i \,\text{SPD}_{\%}^{(i)},
  \quad
  w_i = \frac{\rho^{\,N-1-i}}
             {\displaystyle \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \rho^{\,N-1-j}}
  $$  

  - $0 < \rho < 1$ is the decay rate (e.g. $\rho = 0.9$)  
  - $N$ is the total number of rolling windows (e.g. $4{,}750$)  
  - Weights $w_i$ sum to 1, shifting emphasis toward more recent windows  

> *Note: weights here reflect each window‚Äôs influence, not purchase fractions.*  

---

### üèÜ Final Model Score

Combine **strength** (recency-weighted percentile) and **consistency** (win rate) equally:  

$$
\boxed{
\text{Score}
= 0.5 \times RW_{\text{SPD\%}}
+ 0.5 \times \text{WinRate}
}
$$

---

### ‚úÖ Model Constraints

1. **Positive Daily Purchases**  
   Every day must have:  
   $$
   \text{allocation}_t \;\geq\; 10^{-5}
   $$

2. **Budget Completeness**  
   Total daily allocations per investment window must sum to 1:  
   $$
   \sum_{t=1}^N \text{allocation}_t = 1
   $$

3. **No Forward-Looking Data**  
   Use only current and past data. Future information is strictly prohibited.

## üèÅ Evaluation Criteria

Among **valid** models, winners are those that:  

- **Maximize Final Model Score**  
  Achieve the highest combined score of recency-weighted SPD percentile and win rate.  

- **Interpretability**  
  Provide clear, interpretable logic or feature importance. Avoid opaque black-box hacks.  

- **Demonstrate Novel, Rigorous Bitcoin Analytics**  
  Use non-trivial, statistically sound techniques rather than simplistic heuristics.  

- **Reproducibility**  
  Code must adhere to our data formats, library versions, and environment specs so it runs end-to-end in our evaluation engine.  

- **Adaptability to Rolling Deployment**  
  Model logic must be modular and self-contained so it can be applied to any future 12-month window using only historical data.
